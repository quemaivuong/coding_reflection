💭 The Story Behind This
I created this portfolio after completing a Python programming fundamentals course. The journey was challenging—filled with errors, confusion, and moments of doubt. But it was also transformative.

This site exists to remind others (and myself) that:

Everyone struggles when learning to code
Mistakes are part of the learning process
Progress isn't linear
You don't need to know everything
There's a place for you in tech
If you're on your own coding journey, know that you're not alone. Keep going. You've got this.
